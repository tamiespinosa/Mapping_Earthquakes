# Mapping_Earthquakes

The objective of this challenge is to map earthquake data from the past 7 days, to include an overlayer to only show the major earthquakes, and an overlay with the techtonic plates. The earthquake markers will be colored and sized according to the earthquake magnitude, and there will be a legend to identify the different colors.

The final project is under Earthquake_Challenge folder.

We will be using leaflet, D3 libraries, javascript, html and CSS languages and mapbox api in order to accomplish this objective.
